Quiz 1

- What does the analogy "AI is the new electricity" refer to?

```
Similar to electricity starting about 100 years ago. AI is transforming multiple industries.
```

- Which of the following are reasons that didn't allow Deep Learning to be developed during '80s?

```
Interesting applications such as image recognotion require large amounts of data that were not available.
```

``` 
Limited compulational power.
```

- When building a neural network to predict housing price from features like size, the number of bedrooms, zip code, and wealth, it is necessary to come up with features in between input and output like family size and school quality. True/False?

```
False
```

- A demographic dataset with statistics on different cities' population, GDP per capita, and economic growth is an example of "unstructured" data because it contains data coming from different sources. True/False?

```
False
```

- Why is an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) used for machine translation, say translating English to French? (Check all that apply.)

```
It can be trained as a supervised learning problem.
```

```
It is applicable when the input/output is a sequence (e.g. a sequence of words).
```

- Which of the following best describes the role of AI in the expression "an AI-powered society"?

```
AI is an essential ingredient in realizing tasks, in industry and in personal life.
```

- Which of these are reasons for Deep Learning recently taking off? (Check the three options that apply.)

```
We have access to a lot more data.
```

```
We have access to a lot more computational power.
```

```
Deep learning has resulted in significant improvements in important applications such as online advertising, speech recognition, and image recognition.
```

- When experienced deep learning engineers work on a new problem, they can usually use insight from previous problems to train a good model on the first try, without needing to iterate multiple times through different models. True/False?
  
```
False
```

- Features of animals, such as weight, height, and color, are used for classification between cats, dogs, or others. This is an example of "structured" data, because they are represented as arrays in a computer. True/False?

```
True
Yes. The data can be represented by columns of data. This is an example of structured data, unlike images of the animal.
```

- RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) are good for data with a temporal component. True/False?

```
True
```

- Which of the following are examples of unstructed data? Choose all that apply.

```
Images for bird recognition.
```

```
Sound files for speech recognition.
```

```
Text describing size and number of pages of books.
```

- A dataset is composed of age and weight data for several people. This dataset is an example of "structured" data because it is represented as an array in a computer. True/False?

```
True
```

- Assuming the trends decribed in the previous question's figure are accurate (and hoping you got the axis labels right), which of the following are true? (Check all that apply.)

```
Increasing the size of a neural network generally does not hurt an algorithm's performance, and it may help significantly. 
```

```
Increasing the training set size generally does not hurt an algorithm's performance, and it may help significantly.
